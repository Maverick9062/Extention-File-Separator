## Extention-File-Seperator

It is a simple python based extension files seperator.

It is used to separate extension files like mp4,docx,pdf or etc into an individual file of a particular extension(like mp3,docx). 

For example:
- If you have any audio files of extensions like mp3,m4a,.wav,etc.Then it will create a new file called audioFiles where your all audio files will be stored.

# This project uses the following modules of python:

- os module
- shutil module





## Steps

- Open any python IDE you like.
- Run this code using command "python Project.py"
- It will request you to input path where all the files are kept. 
- Copy the folder path you want to check and paste it on input.
- It will automatically separate all the extensions into an individual file of extension.
- For this project, i used three folder names called audio,video and document files where all there extensions are saved on their particular extension file.
